# non_linear_video

A Flutter application portraying Interactive Non-Linear Video Session

## Getting Started


1.The first screen displays a play button. Clicking on it opens up the video session based on human  emotions, providing all the playback controls and an option to choose the emotion the user is feeling.

2.The second screen plays the video session with playback controls such as play, pause, and seek. By clicking on the three dots located at the bottom left of the screen, the settings menu opens up, providing options to select the user's current emotion or reset the application to its initial video explaining human emotions.

3.When the user clicks on 'Select Emotion,' they are given the choice to select an emotion based on how they are feeling. The interaction engine interacts with the Video Session Controller and BLoC to change the video and provide a specifically tailored video based on the selected emotion.
